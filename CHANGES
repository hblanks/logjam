0.0.4-beta
----------

* Fix ``logjam-upload`` so that it keeps track of the files it's
  uploaded. This considerably reduces the number of S3 GET requests
  made to list objects in the target bucket.

* Fix ``logjam-compress`` so that if the compressed path for log
  already exists, it won't replace the file. Instead, it compresses
  the log file into a different path, which includes a prefix
  denoting that this was the result of a pre-existing compressed
  logfile.

* Add optional exception reporting from sentry if $SENTRY_DSN is
  provided in the environment and raven (the Sentry client) is
  installed.



0.0.3
-----

* First working release
