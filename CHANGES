* Fix ``logjam-compress`` so that if the compressed path for log
  already exists, it won't replace the file. Instead, it compresses
  the log file into a different path, which includes a prefix
  denoting that this was the result of a pre-existing compressed
  logfile.

* Add optional exception reporting from sentry if $SENTRY_DSN is
  provided in the environment and raven (the Sentry client) is
  installed.
